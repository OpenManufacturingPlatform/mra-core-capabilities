## Persist Data

The Persist capability allows for data to be collected, retained and managed within the manufacturing platform. 

Storing data is a fundament capability of every platform. The platform must support these basic data structure types: structured, unstructured, semi-structured and timeseries data. The latter is gaining much importance as they are an efficient means to enable insights from historical data. Emerging paradigms like Lakehouse are combining some aspects of the different approaches. 

Cloud solutions have significantly reduced the cost of data storage. Nevertheless, a conscious selection of the data to be stored is still important as the cost of stored data can not only be measured by the direct storage service cost: Many data lake projects failed as it was impossible to obtain meaningful information after some time. 

Additionally, the speed to gain access to data is an important cost aspect. Direct access to data is usually 10 times more expensive than to archived data. Data archiving therefore is key feature to keep cost under control. 

### Structured

Enables the storage, consumption and query of data that has a strictly defined content model (schema on write) - e.g. relational and graph databases. 

### Unstructured

Enables the storage, consumption and query of data that has no defined content model 	(schema on read) - e.g. object stores and filesystems. 

### Semi-structured

Enables the storage, consumption and query of data that may have unstructured or 	(potentially multiple) structured content models â€“ e.g. document databases. 

### Timeseries

Enables the storage, consumption and query of data that is ordered chronologically (such as events emitted from plant equipment).
