# Manufacturing Reference Architecture Core Capabilities Collection

Welcome, this is the OMP Manufacturing Reference Architecture Working Group.

The goal of OMP is to provide an open, based on industry standards, higher-level non-committal manufacturing reference architecture, enabling companies to align their shop floor infrastructure and systems while enabling industrial solutions to integrate faster.   

In this repository, a list of software capabilities that a MRA needs to
provide is presented. Software capabilities are provided by platforms
and applications to implement use cases. See below for a definition and
context on capabilities.

The goal is to provide a repository of capabilities, that can be easily
referenced from the different use cases which rely on the capabilities
and provide more details and context on a certain capability, e.g.
special considerations in manufacturing context.

Start by reading the [Introduction and Overview](IntroductionAndOverview.md)!
